# Terraria-Clone
A clone of the popular game, Terraria, developed using Java and the LibGDX framework. The reason that this project is open-source is to encourage community contributions and create a game centered around the development done by those in the gaming community. Contributions are heavily welcomed and I would love to see developers being able to place their own mark on the game.

# Contributing
When adding your own features to the game or modifying existing code, there are a few things to keep in mind to ensure that your pull requests are accepted.
1. Because the game is aimed at being developed for mobile devices, the processing and graphical power that we're able to work with is very minimal when put in comparison with desktop computers and laptops. A game that runs at 60 FPS on a desktop computer may only run at 20 FPS on mobile devices depending on the optimization techniques applied. Before pushing new code to the repository, be sure to test your version of the game on an Android device to ensure that it runs smoothly. If you don't have an Android device to test it on, use an application like [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) which provides emulators of Android devices. 

# Development Goals
- Run efficiently and smoothly on Android devices while still including many of the features that you'd find on the desktop version of Terraria.
- Customize the game by adding own ideas and features into it
