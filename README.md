# Terraria-Clone
A clone of the popular game, Terraria, developed using Java and the LibGDX framework. The reason that this project is open-source is to encourage community contributions and create a game centered around the development done by those in the gaming community. Contributions are heavily welcomed and I would love to see developers being able to place their own mark on the game.

### Contributing
When adding your own features to the game or modifying existing code, there are a few things to keep in mind to ensure that your pull requests are accepted. Before submitting new additions, be sure to reference the list below as it may be modified in the future.

1. Because the game is aimed at being developed for mobile devices, the processing and graphical power that we're able to work with is very small when put in comparison with desktop computers and laptops. A game that runs at 60 FPS on a desktop computer may only run at 20 FPS on a mobile device depending on the optimization techniques applied. Before pushing new code to the repository, be sure to test your version of the game on an Android device to ensure that it runs smoothly. If you don't have an Android device to test it on, use an application like [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) which provides emulators of Android devices. 
2. Following proper coding standards is a must. Be sure to follow object-oriented design standards, implement design patterns when able to, and document all code following documentation standards for Java.  
3. If your additions add a new utility or module to the game, be sure to add a separate testing application to the "test" package of the code. This application should simply provide test cases, showing the functions of your new additions. For example, you can find the [InventoryTest Application](https://github.com/baseball435/Terraria-Clone/blob/master/core/src/com/jmr/terraria/test/InventoryTest.java) which simply tests different methods of the inventory class. You can also find the [Noise Visualization Utility](https://github.com/baseball435/Terraria-Clone/blob/master/core/src/com/jmr/terraria/test/NoiseVisualizationScreen.java) which allows you to test and visualize the outcomes of Simplex Noise.
