ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* AndroidManifest.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* libs/gdx-1.5.5.jar => gameEngine/libs/gdx-1.5.5.jar
* libs/gdx-freetype-natives.jar => gameEngine/libs/gdx-freetype-natives.jar
* libs/gdx-freetype.jar => gameEngine/libs/gdx-freetype.jar
* libs/gdx-sources.jar => gameEngine/libs/gdx-sources.jar
* libs/gdx.jar => gameEngine/libs/gdx.jar
* src/ => gameEngine/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
